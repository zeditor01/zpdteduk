ZPDT Education Curriculum for ANZ z Stack Team

This is a repository of ZPDT and z/OS skills sessions for the IBM ANZ zStack Team.

* Education Lessons will be held weekly at 3pm on Fridays for 1 hour.
* Sessions will be recorded for the benefit of those that miss a session.
* The first 8 lessons are being drafted. Most of these lessons will overflow beyond a single education session.
* The style of the education will be hands on, rather than death by powerpoint.
* Homework will be set at the end of each lesson, to encourage students to practice what they have learnt, and ask for help as needed.


The first 8 lessons will be a learning experience for Ben and Neale too. We will review how well the sessions have gone, and make changes as required for further lessons.
