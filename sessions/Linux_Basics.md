# Linux Basics

this section assumes that you have installed Linux, assigned a fixed TCPIP address, and created a logon userid and password.

## Starting Linux Apps

After logging on to CentOS Linux, you can open apps by clicking on the "Activities" menu on the top-left of the screen. This will bring up a menu like the one below.

## Opening a remote desktop.
For demos it's really handy to connect from your work laptop into the Linux and z/OS systems, so that you can share your screen via Teams. This needs you to install xrdp on linux, open the xrdp port in any firewalls, and open the Remote Desktop Connection app on your work laptop.

Installing xrdp is easy.
